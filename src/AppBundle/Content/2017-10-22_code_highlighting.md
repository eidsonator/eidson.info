# Code Highlighting in HTML

![alt text](/img/computer_code.png "Logo Title Text 1")

I've been wanting to start blogging for quite some time now, and I figured there is no time like the present.
I am familiar with both wordpress and Drupal, but I wanted to "roll my own" both for flexibility and as a learning experience.
Since my blog was more than likely going to be code heavy, one thing that was really important to me was code highlighting in the display.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.12.0/styles/default.min.css">
```

```html
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.12.0/highlight.min.js"></script>
```
