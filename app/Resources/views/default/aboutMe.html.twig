<h1>About me...</h1>

<p>I am a father, web developer, and in my free time (what is this 'free time' I speak of, you say?) a music aficionado.</p>

<p>I have two (usually) wonderful kids, Marley and Simon, who keep me out of trouble.
    A smart and sassy teenage girl, with all of the joys that those years can bring.
    Along with a unique young man and our conversations have become semi-Facebook famous;
    all of my friends keep suggesting that I write a book featuring our exchanges,
    but I think a blog might be a better place for them. Coming soon is a 'Simon Says' section.
</p>

<p>I have been employed for the last five years at a manfacturing company writing mostly in-house,
    web-based CRUD interfaces to interact with dozens of databases. For the most part,
    I am writing web 2.0 applications in PHP7/CoffeeScript/HTML/CSS, using Symfony3, Angular, jQuery and Semantic-ui,
    although I do have a lot of older projects written using Backbone and Bootstrap.
    I have one small project using Python, a lot of small utility scripts written in Ruby,
    as well as a year and a half experience supporting legacy C++ code.
    I am constantly learning new frameworks (currently Laravel, lets see how good I am at keeping this updated)
    and trying to improve my code on my personal time.
    The scariest thing for me is looking at code I wrote six months ago!
</p>

<p>I am a music junkie who enjoys accumulating vinyl records, collecting vintage (pre-1980) stereo equiptment,
    and enjoying live music performances (although, not as many now as I once did).
    My record collection consists of approximately 80% jazz music, but my taste in music is wildly eclectic.
    You might catch me listening to bluegrass, 80's hip-hop, classical, and jazz standards back-to-back on any given day.
    I did spend a short time in my life as a studio and live sound engineer,
    but that lifestyle didn't fit the best with the aspirations of a family man.
